'''Apollo 11''' was the [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] that [[Moon landing|landed]] the first two humans on the [[Moon]]. Mission commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]], both American, landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] ''Eagle'' on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to Earth. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] piloted the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]] ''Columbia'' alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.

Apollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 9:32 am [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

After being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module ''Eagle'' and landed in the [[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and [[splashdown|splashed down]] in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

The landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively ended the [[Space Race]] and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]: "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |title=Man on the Moon: Kennedy speech ignited the dream |work=CNN |last=Stenger |first=Richard |date=May 25, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606035837/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |archivedate=June 6, 2010}}</ref>

The crew assignment of [[Neil Armstrong]] as Commander, [[Jim Lovell]] as Command Module Pilot (CMP) and [[Buzz Aldrin]] as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was officially announced on November 20, 1967.{{sfn|Brooks et al.|2009|p=374}} Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew on an American mission,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} the first being that of [[Apollo 10]]).{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=72}} An all-veteran crew would not be flown again until [[STS-26]] in 1988.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of [[Gemini 12]]. The crew was initially assigned as the backup for [[Apollo 9]]. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), [[Apollo 8]] and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312–313}} There would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] on the Apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288–289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and, when he recovered, Collins joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, [[Fred Haise]] filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}}

===Backup crew===

|crew3_up     = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise, Jr.]]
}}

The backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander), [[William Anders]] as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} In early 1969, he accepted a job with the [[National Space Council]] effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly would ultimately be assigned as the prime crew of [[Apollo 13]].{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}}

After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'', assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] director [[George M. Low]] to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names ''Snowcone'' and ''Haystack'' were used and put in the news release.<ref name="Snowcone">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/pdf/a11-techsum.pdf |title=Technical Information Summary, Apollo-11 (AS-506) Apollo Saturn V Space Vehicle |date=June 25, 1969 |work=[[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C.

The Command Module was named ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' after the ''[[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]]'', the giant cannon shell "spacecraft" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''. It also referenced [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], a personification of the United States. The Lunar Module was named ''Eagle'' for the [[national bird]] of the United States, the [[bald eagle]], which was featured prominently on the mission insignia.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=334–335}}

===Insignia===
[[File:Apollo 11 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-416).jpg|thumb|Apollo 11 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]
The Apollo 11 [[Mission patch|mission insignia]] was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for "peaceful lunar landing by the United States". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose an eagle as the symbol, put an [[olive branch]] in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. NASA officials felt that the talons of the eagle looked too "warlike" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. Armstrong was concerned that "eleven" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with "Apollo 11";{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=332–334}} they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would "be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing".{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=332}} All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

When the [[Eisenhower Dollar|Eisenhower dollar coin]] was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |title=1971–78 Dollar Eisenhower |work=CoinSite |publisher=ROKO Design Group, Inc. |date=1994 |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> The design was also used for the smaller [[Susan B.

This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=191–192}}

In addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information [[Jack King (NASA)|Jack King]] providing commentary. President [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] viewed the proceedings from the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A [[Saturn V]] launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of {{convert|100.4|nmi|km}} by {{convert|98.9|nmi|km}}, twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the [[S-IVB]] third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver was performed: this involved separating the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into [[heliocentric orbit|orbit around the Sun]].{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=102–110}}

On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter [[lunar orbit]].

On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module ''Eagle'' separated from the Command Module ''Columbia''. Collins, alone aboard ''Columbia'', inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were "long"; they would land miles west of their target point.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} above the surface of the Moon, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM navigation and guidance computer]] distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected "1202" and "1201" program alarms. Inside [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] in Houston, Texas, computer engineer [[Jack Garman]] told [[Flight controller#Guidance Officer (GUIDANCE or GUIDO)|guidance officer]] [[Steve Bales]] it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |last2=Aldrin |first2=Edwin E., Jr. |authorlink2=Buzz Aldrin |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=A Yellow Caution Light |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-11-4.html}} Chapter 11.4.</ref>

{{Quote|Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, ''I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks''; i.e., the ones needed for landing&nbsp;... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software.

The sequence that occurred in the Apollo 11 landing was successful because of its global error detection and recovery system. This included the restart capability to "kill and start over again" and recompute and the display interface routines ("priority displays") providing the ability, in the case of an emergency, to interrupt nominal displays with higher priority alarm displays. Steps previously taken to create solutions that took advantage of this multiprogramming environment suggested solutions for multiprocessing. Although only one process is actively executing at a given time in a multiprogramming environment, other processes in the same system―sleeping or waiting―exist in parallel with the executing process. With this as a backdrop, the priority display mechanisms were created, essentially changing the man-machine interface between the astronauts and the onboard flight software from synchronous to asynchronous displays so that a mission could be reconfigured in real time should it become necessary to do so.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Margaret H. |last2=Hackler |first2=William R. |date=December 2008 |title=Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=34–43 |journal=Computer |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |issn=0018-9162 |doi=10.1109/MC.2008.541 |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.541 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>}}|Letter from [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret H.

When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a {{convert|300|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter crater (later determined to be [[West (lunar crater)|West crater]], named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control<ref name="Digital Apollo">{{Cite book |last=Mindell |first=David A. |title=Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight |date=2008 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=195–197 |isbn=978-0-262-13497-2 |lccn=2007032255}}</ref> and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.<ref name="ALSJ 1" />

Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.<ref name="ALSJ 1" />

Throughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]]. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the {{convert|67|in|cm|0|adj=on}} probes hanging from ''Eagle''{{'s}} footpads had touched the surface, and he said: "Contact light!" Three seconds later, ''Eagle'' landed and Armstrong said "Shutdown." Aldrin immediately said "Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of [[detent]]." Armstrong acknowledged "Out of detent. Auto" and Aldrin continued "Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in."

[[Charles Duke]], CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying "We copy you down, ''Eagle''."

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with "Engine arm is off", before responding to Duke with the words, "Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed." Armstrong's unrehearsed<ref name="failure">{{cite AV media |type=TV production |title=Failure is Not an Option |publisher=[[The History Channel]] |date=August 24, 2003 |oclc=54435670}}</ref> change of call sign from "Eagle" to "Tranquility Base" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:

{{quote|This is the LM pilot.

At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis]]) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the [[Webster, Texas|Webster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of ''Guideposts'' magazine and in his book ''Return to Earth''. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.<ref name="chaikin">{{Cite book |last=Chaikin |first=Andrew |title=A Man on the Moon: The Triumphant Story Of The Apollo Space Program |date=1994 |publisher=Penguin Group |location=New York |pages=204, 623 |isbn=0-14-027201-1}}</ref>

The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.

At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against ''Eagle''{{'s}} side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface.<ref name="neil82">{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong, first man to step on the Moon, dies at 82 |first=Paul |last=Duggan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/neil-armstrong-first-man-to-step-on-the-moon-dies-at-82/2012/08/25/7091c8bc-412d-11e0-a16f-4c3fe0fd37f0_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name="ALSJ 4">{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html |title=One Small Step |date=1995 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The first landing used [[slow-scan television]] incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.<ref name="Blunder 5">{{cite news |title=One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost Moon pictures |last=Macey |first=Richard |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-giant-blunder-for-mankind-how-nasa-lost-moon-pictures/2006/08/04/1154198328978.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=August 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The signal was received at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in the United States but with better fidelity by [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] in Australia.

While still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a [[lunar plaque|plaque]] mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:

Armstrong intended to say "That's one small step for a man", but the word "''a''" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said "for a man", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the "a" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words "for a" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near [[Parkes Observatory]]. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the "a" may have been spoken but obscured by static.<ref name="Straight Dope">{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_362.html |last=Adams |first=Cecil |title=Did astronaut Neil Armstrong muff his historic "one small step" line?}}</ref><ref name="snopes a">{{snopes | link = http://www.snopes.com/quotes/onesmall.asp | title = One Small Step }}</ref>

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/10010.pdf |title=Lunar Sample Compendium: Contingency Soil (10010) |last=Meyer |first=Charles |date=2009 |work=Astromaterials Research & Exploration Science |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

Twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=102–110}}  Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, "Magnificent desolation."<ref name="ALSJ 4" />

[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz Aldrin poses on the Moon, allowing Neil Armstrong to photograph both of them using the visor's reflection]]

In addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,<ref>{{cite news |title=Events of 1969: Apollo 11 |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/ |work=UPI.com |publisher=United Press International |date=1969 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod {{convert|68|ft|m}} from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.

Armstrong said that moving in the [[Gravitation of the Moon|lunar gravity]], one-sixth of Earth's, was "even perhaps easier than the simulations&nbsp;... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around."<ref name="ALSJ 4"/> Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle''{{'s}} shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.<ref name="ALSJ 4"/>

The astronauts planted a [[Lunar Flag Assembly|specially designed U.S. flag]] on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Sometime later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/apollo11.html |title=Exhibit: Apollo 11 and Nixon |date=March 1996 |work=American Originals |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref> Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but [[Frank Borman]], who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.<ref>This was related by Frank Borman during the 2008 documentary ''[[When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions]]'', part 2.</ref> Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:

[[File:Nixon Telephones Armstrong on the Moon - GPN-2000-001672.jpg|thumb|left|President Nixon speaks to Armstrong and Aldrin on the Moon]]
'''Nixon:''' Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.

'''Armstrong:''' Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.

The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.

They deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Ranging]] [[Retroreflector#Retroreflectors on the Moon|Retroreflector]] (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater <!-- There is no "East Crater", see https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html --> while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the [[geological hammer]] to pound in the tubes – the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.

[[File:Apollo 11 photo map.svg|thumb|Map showing landing site and photos taken]]
Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: [[armalcolite]], [[tranquillityite]], and [[pyroxferroite]]. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.

During this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.<ref name="ALSJ 5">{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html |title=EASEP Deployment and Closeout |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |date=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.<ref name="neilmoonwalk">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/10469-neil-armstrong-explains-famous-apollo-11-moonwalk.html |title=Neil Armstrong Explains His Famous Apollo 11 Moonwalk |date=December 10, 2010 |work=[[space.com]] |publisher=[[TechMediaNetwork, Inc.]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>

Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing {{convert|21.55|kg|lb}} of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one [[Hasselblad]] camera, and other equipment.

President Nixon's speech writer [[William Safire]] had prepared ''In Event of Moon Disaster'' for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.<ref name="lostinspace">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/white-house-lost-space-scenarios |title=White House 'Lost In Space' Scenarios |date=August 8, 2005 |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}} Scanned copy of the "In Event of Moon Disaster" memo.</ref> The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Story of a Tragedy That Was Not to Be |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/07/news/mn-53678 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 7, 1999 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name="safire">{{cite news |title=Essay; Disaster Never Came |first=William |last=Safire |authorlink=William Safire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/12/opinion/essay-disaster-never-came.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref> According to the plan, Mission Control would "close down communications" with the LM, and a clergyman would "commend their souls to the deepest of the deep" in a public ritual likened to [[burial at sea]]. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to [[Rupert Brooke]]'s First World War poem, "[[The Soldier (poem)|The Soldier]]".<ref name="safire"/> The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.

While moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the [[circuit breaker]] that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.<ref name="ALSJ 6" /> Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in ''Eagle''{{'s}} ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.

After more than 21½ total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a [[Retroreflector#Retroreflectors on the Moon|retroreflector]] array used for the [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]] and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure [[moonquake]]s. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the [[Apollo 11 goodwill messages|goodwill statements]] by Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], Kennedy, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]], and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages |date=July 13, 1969 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf |format=PDF |id=Release No: 69-83F |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> (In his 1989 book, ''Men from Earth'', Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating [[Cosmonaut]]s [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]] and [[Yuri Gagarin]].) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book ''Moonshot'', Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.

Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple:{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=102–110}} "The ascent stage of the LM separated&nbsp;... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the [[attitude indicator]], but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over."<ref name="Apollo-11 (27)" /> Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least {{Convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}} from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.

After rendezvous with ''Columbia'', ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the [[Apollo 12]] flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle''{{'s}} orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an "uncertain location" on the lunar surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |title=Apollo Tables |last=Williams |first=David R. |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001125211/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |archivedate=October 1, 2006 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The location is uncertain because the ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: <blockquote>...&nbsp;The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly&nbsp;... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people&nbsp;... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, "Thank you very much."</blockquote>

Aldrin added: <blockquote>This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown&nbsp;... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?"</blockquote>

Armstrong concluded: <blockquote>The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.<ref name="Apollo-11 (27)" /></blockquote>

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.<ref>{{cite news |title=The 10-year-old who helped Apollo 11, 40 years later |last=Rodriguez |first=Rachel |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/20/apollo11.irpt/index.html |work=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Splashdown and quarantine===

At 16:44 UTC the [[drogue parachute]]s had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During [[splashdown]], the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. "Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers", was Armstrong's last official transmission from ''Columbia''. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a [[sea anchor]] to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back [[pathogen]]s from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the ''Hornet''. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a [[sodium hypochlorite]] solution and the Command Module wiped with [[Betadine]] to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.<ref name="hornet">{{Cite book |last=Fish |first=Bob |others=Foreword by [[Richard F.

The Command Module ''Columbia'' was displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central ''Milestones of Flight'' exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the [[Wright Flyer]], the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Bell X-1]], the [[North American X-15]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] spacecraft ''[[Friendship 7]]'', and [[Gemini 4]]. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's ''Apollo to the Moon'' exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] annex near [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Chantilly, Virginia.

In 2009, the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.

In March 2012 a team of specialists financed by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]] located the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engines]] that launched Apollo 11 into space.

A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:
{{quote|It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken&nbsp;... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today&nbsp;... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date&nbsp;... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts – Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Moon landings: British scientists salute space heroes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/5848707/Moon-landings-British-scientists-salute-space-heroes.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=July 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308224145/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/5848707/Moon-landings-British-scientists-salute-space-heroes.html |archivedate=March 8, 2013 |df=mdy}}</ref>}}
